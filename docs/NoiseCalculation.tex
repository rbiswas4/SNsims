\section{Noise Calculation}

The assumption is that the noise of a point source with flux $F$ has a variance 
 obtained by quadratically adding the variance of a background $N_0^2$ and a quantity proportional to the Poisson Noise due to the source.
\be
N^2 = N_0^2 + \alpha F 
\ee
Given a source Flux, the noise has two unknown quantities $\alpha$ and $N_0$.
Therefore, it is posible to eliminate one of these variables in terms of 
quantities at a standard SNR.
