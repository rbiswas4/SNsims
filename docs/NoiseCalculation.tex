\section{Noise Calculation}

The assumption is that the noise of a point source with flux $F$ has a variance 
 obtained by quadratically adding the variance of a background $N_0^2$ and a quantity proportional to the Poisson Noise due to the source.
\be
N^2 = N_0^2 + \alpha F 
\ee
Given a source Flux, the noise has two unknown quantities $\alpha$ and $N_0$.
Therefore, it is posible to eliminate one of these variables in terms of 
quantities at a standard SNR. Let us consider this standard SNR to be 5.
Then, we have 
\be
\frac{F_5^2}{N_0^2 + \alpha F_5} = 25
\ee
implying we can eliminate 
\be
\alpha = 0.04\cdot F_5 - \left(N_0\over F_5\right)^2
\ee
At the linear level, the noise in the magnitude $\sigma_m$ is 
\beqn
\sigma_m^2 &=& \left({2.5 \over \log{(10)}}\right)^2 (N/F)^2 \\
&\approx& \left({N_0 \over F }\right)^2 + \alpha \left({1 \over F}\right) \\
&=& \left({N_0 \over F_5}\right)^2 \left(F_5/F\right)^2
\eeqn
