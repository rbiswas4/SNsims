\section{Noise Calculation}

The assumption is that the noise of a point source with flux $F$ has a variance 
 obtained by quadratically adding the variance of a background $N_0^2$ and a quantity proportional to the Poisson Noise due to the source.
\be
N^2 = N_0^2 + \alpha F 
\ee
Given a source Flux, the noise has two unknown quantities $\alpha$ and $N_0$.
Therefore, it is posible to eliminate one of these variables in terms of 
quantities at a standard SNR. Let us consider this standard SNR to be 5.
Then, we have 
\be
\frac{F_5^2}{N_0^2 + \alpha F_5} = 25
\ee
implying we can eliminate 
\be
\alpha = F_5 \left( 0.04 - \left(N_0 \over F_5\right)^2 \right)
\ee
At the linear level, the noise in the magnitude $\sigma_m$ is 
\beqn
\sigma_m^2 &=& \left({2.5 \over \log{(10)}}\right)^2 (N/F)^2 \\
&\approx& \left({N_0 \over F }\right)^2 + \alpha \left({1 \over F}\right) \\
&=& \left({N_0 \over F_5}\right)^2 \left(F_5/F\right)^2 + \left( 0.04 - ({N_0/F_5})^2\right) (F_5/F) \\
&=& \gamma x^2 + (0.04 - \gamma) x
\eeqn
We could put back the initial missing factor $\approx 1$ to get 
\be
\sigma_m^2  = \left(2.5/\log{(10)}\right)^2 \left( \gamma x^2  + (0.04 - \gamma ) x \right)
\ee
where 
$\gamma \equiv N_0/ F_5 $ and $x \equiv F_5/F = 10.0^{0.4(m-m_5)}$
