Class for describing tesselations of the sphere

Following the usual usage, a tesselation or tiling of the sphere is a 
covering of the sphere by a set of gemetrical shapes called tiles, such that
each point of the sphere belongs to one and only one tile (we will be negligent
about edges of tiles). Thus, no two tiles overlap, and there is no point on the
sphere which does not belong to a tile.

Such tilings provide a natural spatial grouping of supernovae on the sky. Such
spatial groupings lead to similar (if not same) observational properties in
terms of the set of observational pointings, as well as the sky properties (eg.
seeing, psf, airmass, MW extinction etc.). The similarities increase as the size of the tiles
decrease.  Therefore, a sensible way to distribute SN simulations is by grouping
the simulations on small tiles together. 

Allowed tilings must satisfy certain properties as encoded in the abstract base
class below as well as listed here. Additionally, there are desired properties
that are hepful (for example in speeding up the process), but not essential to
the computations. Such methods may involve properties like equal area of tiles,
hierarchical structure of times, efficient queries, or precomputed results for
OpSim outputs.

Methods and Attributes Required and Intended Usage:
---------------------------------------------------
    - tileIDSequence : Obtain the entire set of tiles which cover the unit
        sphere 
    - pointingSequenceForTile :  A method to obtain the maximal set of
        pointings that may overlap a point on a tile. Obviously, there can be
        points in a tile which do not overlap with subsets of such pointings.
        The intended usage is to simulate all SN in a tile together by using
        the set of maximal pointings. This can be done in modes
